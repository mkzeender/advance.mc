# Advance.MC
A python compiler to mcfunction.

Advance.MC is both a python framework and compiler that compiles a python program to a Minecraft datapack.

## Purpose
Minecraft datapacks are much safer and easier to install than Java modifications. They are safe because they do not allow arbitrary code execution, and they are great for multiplayer because only the server needs to install them. However, datapacks are difficult and tedious to write from scratch. Advance.MC makes the process easier and more flexible by compiling from python.
